# PredictionMarket

- Project done for the Ethereum Developer course from [B9Lab](https://academy.b9lab.com/dashboard). It was an exercise where we had to create a smart contract that would work as prediction market. It used [React Truffle Box](https://truffleframework.com/boxes) to build the front end.
